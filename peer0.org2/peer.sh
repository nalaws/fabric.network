# Before you can bring up a network, each organization needs to generate the crypto
# material that will define that organization on the network. Because Hyperledger
# Fabric is a permissioned blockchain, each node and user on the network needs to
# use certificates and keys to sign and verify its actions. In addition, each user
# needs to belong to an organization that is recognized as a member of the network.
# You can use the Cryptogen tool or Fabric CAs to generate the organization crypto
# material.

# By default, the sample network uses cryptogen. Cryptogen is a tool that is
# meant for development and testing that can quickly create the certificates and keys
# that can be consumed by a Fabric network. The cryptogen tool consumes a series
# of configuration files for each organization in the "organizations/cryptogen"
# directory. Cryptogen uses the files to generate the crypto  material for each
# org in the "organizations" directory.

# You can also Fabric CAs to generate the crypto material. CAs sign the certificates
# and keys that they generate to create a valid root of trust for each organization.
# The script uses Docker Compose to bring up three CAs, one for each peer organization
# and the ordering organization. The configuration file for creating the Fabric CA
# servers are in the "organizations/fabric-ca" directory. Within the same directory,
# the "registerEnroll.sh" script uses the Fabric CA client to create the identities,
# certificates, and MSP folders that are needed to create the test network in the
# "organizations/ordererOrganizations" directory.
